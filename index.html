        <h2 style="color: black;"><i>Briefly about me;</i></h2>
        <p>I am a Ugandan woman new to the field of tech, currently passionately venturing in Software Engineering at Ground-Breaker Talents.</p>
        <h2 style="color:black;">Professional History</h2>
        <p>I have a Diploma in Education Secondary(FRE) from Kyambogo University.  I taught at Mount of Olives College Kakiri to complete school<br> practice as required during the study of the course. However, I pursued French as a language because I love it and I knew I could do a lot<br>with it but teaching it was never my main goal.</p>
        <p>I have always had a love for technology and making things work I just didn't know how to make my passion professional, I almost became<br> a mechanic but then I found out that there's more to computer than <i>MS Office and emails.</i> There's speaking to the computers! So currently,<br>here I am on a scholarship finding my way into the exciting and unending world of Soft Engineering and IT in general.</p>
        <h2 style="color: black;">Future Aspirations</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a beneficiary at Ground Breaker Talents and a student of Refactory Academy. By the end of the study progam, I aim to be able to build Artificial Intelligence and also In future, I plan to keep growing my IT skills and knowledge. I would like to go further and further in study and practice in this exciting career.<br>
        I hope to start up a tech company focused on the production of phones and computers.<br>
        <a href="Bobotek.html" target="_blank">Here's a mental picture of that company</a></p>
