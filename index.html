        <p>I have always had a love for technology and making things work I just didn't know how to make my passion professional, I almost became<br> a mechanic but then I found out that there's more to computer than <i>MS Office and emails.</i> There's speaking to the computers! So currently,<br>here I am on a scholarship finding my way into the exciting and unending world of Soft Engineering and IT in general.</p>
        <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>

By the end of the study progam, I aim to be<br>able to build Artificial Intelligence and also In future, I plan to keep growing my IT skills and knowledge.
